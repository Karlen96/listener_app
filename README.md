# Listener app

Application using flutter framework.

Everyone has heard about Spotify at least once in their life.
That's a very popular application for listening interesting podcasts and episodes.

After enjoying that application I decided to create a new one like Spotify, Audible, Google Play Books.

And I created a new application called a Listener app the main function of this application you can see below.

1) Listen to audio on more sources like Spreaker.
2) Choose your favorite type of listening device.
3) Opportunity to continue listening, after changing position of the episode, changing volume of background mode. 
4) Support the functionality on Android and ios platform.
